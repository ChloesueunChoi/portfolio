        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            SAITMate is a platform designed to enhance communication and networking between students and alumni,
            addressing common challenges such as:<br>
            ‚ú∏ Ineffective communication channels causing delays in student activities.<br>
            ‚ú∏ Lack of mid-term mentorship, especially for specialized subjects.<br>
            ‚ú∏ Mismatch between student expectations and career pathways within their programs.<br>
            By fostering collaboration across programs, SAITMate helps students build connections, share ideas, and
            prepare for their careers more effectively.

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-serif font-semibold text-gray-400 mb-4">Identifying Core Challenges</h2>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            At the start of the project, we conducted user research through surveys and interviews. Key findings
            included:<br>
            üîπ 77% of students struggled to find relevant contacts for networking.<br>
            üîπ Many students and alumni lacked a centralized platform for seamless communication.
            <br>
            <br>
        <h3 class="text-3xl font-serif font-semibold text-gray-400 mb-4">Initial Concept & Limitations</h3>
        Our first design focused on a basic messaging tool, but early feedback revealed missing functionalities:<br>
        ‚ùå No networking features ‚Äì Users wanted tools to connect with alumni based on industry or expertise.<br>
        ‚ùå Lack of resource sharing ‚Äì No centralized location for materials and advice.<br>
        ‚ùå Limited information filtering ‚Äì Users needed better ways to find relevant content.
        These insights led to an iterative design process, refining the platform based on user needs.
